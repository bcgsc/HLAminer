### SYNOPSIS <a name=synopsis></a>
--------

  HLAminer is a pipeline for predicting HLA from shotgun sequence data (ie. whole genome, whole transcriptome/RNA-Seq, exome), at the group and allele resolution.
  It supports predictions from a variety of DNA sequencing technologies including those from Illumina, MGI, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.   
  Predictions are either derived from targeted assembly or direct alignment.

  For quick tests on Illumina RNA-seq data:
  1. Copy ./test-demo/    eg. cp -rf test-demo foo
  2. In folder "foo", edit the patient.fof file to point to your NGS RNAseq data.  Ensure all paths are ok.
  3. For HLA Predictions by Targeted Assembly of Shotgun Reads: execute ./HLAminer/foo/HPTASRrnaseq.sh 
     For HLA Predictions by Read Alignment: execute ./HLAminer/foo/HPRArnaseq.sh

### OVERVIEW <a name=overview></a>
--------

Derivation of HLA class I and class II predictions from shotgun sequence datasets (HLAminer) by:
1) Targeted Assembly of Shotgun Reads (HPTASR)
2) Read Alignment (HPRA)

BEST SHORT READ RESULTS ARE OBTAINED WITH HPTASR WITH READS 100bp AND UP (IDEALLY 150bp).
IT WILL WORK WITH SHORTER READS (50bp) BUT 4-digit HLA ALLELE PREDICTIONS MAY BE AMBIGUOUS 

This clip summarizes the pipeline:

### DESCRIPTION <a name=description></a>
--------

The HLA prediction by targeted assembly of short sequence reads (HPTASR), performs targeted de novo assembly of HLA NGS reads and align the resulting contigs to reference HLA alleles from the IMGT/HLA sequence repository using commodity hardware with standard specifications (<2GB RAM, 2GHz).  Putative HLA types are inferred by mining and scoring the contig alignments and an expect value is determined for each.  The method is accurate, simple and fast to execute and, for transcriptome data, requires low depth of coverage. Known HLA class I/class II reference sequences available from the IMGT/HLA public repository are read by TASR using default options (Warren and Holt 2011) to create a hash table of all possible 15 nt words (k-mers) from these reference sequences. Note that this parameter is customizable and larger k values will yield predictions with increased specificity (at the possible expense of sensitivity). Subsequently, NGS data sets are interrogated for the presence of one of these kmers (on either strand) at the 5’ or 3’ start. Whenever an HLA word is identified, the read is recruited as a candidate for de novo assembly. Upon de novo assembly of all recruited reads, a set of contigs is generated.  Only sequence contigs equal or larger than 200nt in length are considered for further analysis, as longer contigs better resolve HLA allelic variants.  Reciprocal BLASTN alignments are performed between the contigs and all HLA allelic reference sequences. HPTASR mines the alignments, scoring each possible HLA allele identified, computing and reporting an expect value (E-value) based on the chance of contigs characterizing given HLA alleles and, reciprocally, the chance of reference HLA alleles aligning best to certain assembled contig sequences

The HLA prediction from direct read alignment (HPRA) method is conceptually simpler and faster to execute, since paired reads are aligned up-front to reference HLA alleles.  Alignments from the HPTASR and HPRA methods are processed by the same software (HLAminer.pl) to derive HLA-I predictions by scoring and evaluating the probability of each candidate bearing alignments.


### What's new in version 1.4?
--------

Ability to stream the (.sam) output of modern read  aligners, directly into HLAminer.
Initial support for predicting HLA types from long nanopore reads such as those from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
Better information/sub-routine/date tracking in hlaminer 


### What's new in version 1.3?
--------

A more concise HLA allele summary in HLAminer_HPTASR.csv and HLAminer_HPRA.csv (associated .log is unchanged and lists all predictions)
Keeps top two [highest-scoring by HLA group] predictions per gene and only the 'P' designated allele when the summary include HLA Sequences reported to have the same antigen binding domain.
For the original output, refer to the HLAminer_v1-2.pl included in the ./bin directory
A prediction example from MCF-7 PacBio RNA-seq reads is also provided


### What's new in version 1.2?
--------

Updated all HLA sequence databases
Corrected shell script that download HLA sequences to reflect change of location at EBI (ie. fasta sub folder) 
Added support for predictions from direct alignment of single-end reads


### INSTALL <a name=install></a>
--------
<pre>
1. Download and decompress the tar ball
gunzip HLAminer_v1-4.tar.gz 
tar -xvf HLAminer_v1-4.tar
2. Make sure you see the following directories:
./bin
./databases
./docs
./test-demo

3. Read the docs in the ./docs/ folder
4. Change/Add/Adjust the perl shebang line of each .pl and .sh script in the ./bin/ folder as needed
</pre>
From direct Read Alignment (HPRA, faster but less accurate):
HPRArnaseq_classI.sh
HPRArnaseq_classI-II.sh
HPRAwgs_classI.sh
HPRAwgs_classI-II.sh
-and for single end reads-
HPRArnaseq_classI_SE.sh
HPRArnaseq_classI-II_SE.sh
HPRAwgs_classI_SE.sh
HPRAwgs_classI-II_SE.sh


From Targeted Assembly (HPTASR, longer but more accurate):
HPTASRrnaseq_classI.sh
HPTASRrnaseq_classI-II.sh
HPTASRwgs_classI.sh
HPTASRwgs_classI-II.sh

*Running HPTASRwgs(rnaseq)_classI-II.sh will take longer than HPTASRwgs(rnaseq)_classI.sh, due to the reciprocal BLAST step.  You may remove this step from the former (and HLAminer.pl command) to speed things up.  However, this step is helpful in weeding out spurious alignments to HLA references.  That said, if you're solely interested in HLA-I, you have the option to run the latter set of scripts [HPTASRwgs(rnaseq)_classI.sh].

Also, in the ncbiBlastConfig2-2-XX.txt files (bin and test-demo directories), you may adjust the number of threads and number of reported alignments to speed things up. The options have different name depending on the blast version, refer to the blast manual
eg.
v2.2.22
option:description
-a:threads
-v:number of descriptions
-b:number of alignments

v2.2.28
-num_threads:threads
-max_target_seqs:number of hit sequences to report (when output is 5/xml)

In our hands, a few tests show that blast 2.2.22 may be faster than blast+ (2.2.28) while
producing accurate results - HLAminer (Warren et al. 2012) was thoroughly tested with 2.2.22

NCBI blast may be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/
-or-
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/


HLAminer.pl
parseXMLblast.pl

5. You must install perl module Bio::SearchIO to use HPTASR
6. Edit the fullpath location of bwa and other software dependencies in the shell scripts in the ./bin/ folder, as needed
7. For your convenience, ncbi blastall and formatdb have been placed in the ./bin/ folder and executed from the following shell scripts:

NAME,PROCESS,NGS DATA TYPE,PREDICTIONS
HPRArnaseq_classI.sh,Paired read alignment,RNAseq (transcriptome),HLA-I A,B,C genes
HPRArnaseq_classI-II.sh,Paired read alignment,RNAseq (transcriptome),HLA-I A,B,C and HLA-II DP,DQ,DR genes

HPRAwgs_classI.sh,Paired read alignment,Exon capture (exome) and WGS (genome),HLA-I A,B,C genes
HPRAwgs_classI-II.sh,Paired read alignment,Exon capture (exome) and WGS (genome),HLA-I A,B,C and HLA-II DP,DQ,DR genes

HPTASRrnaseq_classI.sh,Targeted assembly of sequence reads,RNAseq (transcriptome),HLA-I A,B,C genes
HPTASRrnaseq_classI-II.sh,Targeted assembly of sequence reads,RNAseq (transcriptome),HLA-I A,B,C and HLA-II DP,DQ,DR genes

HPTASRwgs_classI.sh,Targeted assembly of sequence reads,Exon capture (exome) and WGS (genome),HLA-I A,B,C genes
HPTASRwgs_classI-II.sh,Targeted assembly of sequence reads,Exon capture (exome) and WGS (genome),HLA-I A,B,C and HLA-II DP,DQ,DR genes

Run those scripts by specifying the relative path ../bin/blastall or ../bin/formatdb in the shell scripts AND config file "ncbiBlastConfig.txt".  Make sure HPRA and HPTASR are running in same-level directories to ../bin/ (eg. ../test-demo/)

8. Before running on your data, inspect the ./test-demo/ folder and familiarize yourself with the files and the execution.  
9. When you are ready and the demo works well, place the fullpath location of your short read fastq or fasta files in the "patient.fof" file.
10. Make sure that the following files are in your working directory:

patient.fof
ncbiBlastConfig.txt (specific to the version of blast you are using, see in
../bin and ../test-demo directories

### COMMANDS AND OPTIONS <a name=commands></a>
--------

<pre>

Usage: ../bin/HLAminer.pl [v1.4]
Derivation of HLA class I and II predictions from shotgun sequence datasets
--------------------------------------------------------------------
HPTASR (HLA Predictions by Targeted Assembly of Shotgun Reads):
-b blastn alignments.........................<tig_vs_hla-ncbi.coord>
-r reciprocal blastn.........................<hla_vs_tig-ncbi.coord>
-c contig fasta file.........................<TASRhla200.contigs>
-z minimum contig size.......................<200>
------------------------------- OR ---------------------------------
HPRA (HLA Predictions by Read Alignment):
-a sam alignments............................< -a ngs_vs_hla.sam > or < -a stream >
-e single-end reads used (1=yes/0=no)........<0>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-h hla fasta file............................<HLA_ABC_CDS.fasta>
-p P-designation file........................<hla_nom_p.txt>
-i minimum % sequence identity...............<99>
-q minimum log10 (phred-like) expect value...<30>
-s minimum score.............................<1000>
-n consider null alleles (1=yes/0=no)........<0>
-l label (run name) -optional-


The shell scripts are set to filter out short (<200) contigs that could blur HPTASR predictions.  Feel free to adjust as you see fit.

Likewise, HLAminer.pl runs with the set defaults:
-z minimum contig size.......................<200> (HPTASR)
-i minimum % sequence identity...............<99>  (HPTASR / HPRA)
-q minimum log10 (phred-like) expect value...<30>  (HPTASR / HPRA)
-s minimum score.............................<1000> (HPTASR / HPRA)
-n consider null alleles (1=yes/0=no)........<0> (HPTASR / HPRA)
</pre>

The minimum sequence identity applies to the short read paired alignment or blast alignment, depending on the choice made.  HLA predictions with a phred-like expect value lower than -q or a score lower than -s will not be diplayed.  Because IMGT/HLA reports numerous null alleles, an option exist to consider or not these unexpressed alleles. 

Likewise, TASR-based (Targeted Assembly of Short Reads) predictions could be
improved by using larger k values for assembly (-k). Experimentation for
choosing the ideal k to use depends on the input read length and is warranted. 


### PREDICTING FROM LONG (NANOPORE/PACBIO) READS <a name=nanopore></a>
--------

HLAminer v1.4 provides initial support for HLA prediction from raw uncorrected shotgun nanopore long reads (such as those from Oxford Nanopore Technologies).
HLAminer v1.4 implements a streaming approach to reading .sam alignment files, supporting the alignment of GB worth of read data in a few hours and predictions within seconds of alignment completion, without saving costly .sam files to disk.

We tested the software on the NA19240 WGS promethion dataset (2018, older chemistry).
https://gigabaseorgigabyte.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/promethion-human-genome-na19240/
with data available from ENA at this location:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB26791

1) First, we downloaded read files (ERR2585112 and ERR2585115 from the ENA)
<pre>
nohup wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR258/005/ERR2585115/ERR2585115.fastq.gz &
nohup wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR258/002/ERR2585112/ERR2585112.fastq.gz &
</pre>
2) Then, we predicted HLA by running minimap2 and HLAminer v1.4:
<pre>
/usr/bin/time -v -o minimap_hlaminerERR2585115-1mod.time minimap2 -t 60 -ax map-ont --MD ../database/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_genomic.chr-only-noChr6-HLA-I_II_GEN.fa.gz ERR2585115.fastq.gz | ./HLAminer.pl -h ../database/HLA-I_II_GEN.fasta -s 500 -q 1 -i 1 -p ../database/hla_nom_p.txt -a stream

</pre>
A test is provided at ./test-demo/HPRAwgs_ONTclassI-IIdemo.sh

The output files:
HLAminer_HPRA_ERR2585115.csv
-and-
HLAminer_HPRA_ERR2585115.log

you generate should be comparable* to:
HLAminer_HPRA_ERR2585115_test.csv
-and-
HLAminer_HPRA_ERR2585115_test.log

*exact scores are not to be expected, because they vary based on the HLA sequence database used, which differ from different release of the code (and your own updating of HLA sequence databases, which is highly recommended to do before you use HLAminer).

Results below demonstrate HLAminer's ability to fairly accurately predict HLA-I and -II types from direct [and streamed] nanopore sequencing reads [old chemistry] alignments

FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, A SINGLE SHELL SCRIPT CAN BE RUN FROM ../database TO
UPDATE ALL IMGT-HLA SEQUENCE DATABASES AND CREATE BWA/BLAST INDEXES. JUST KEEP
IN MIND THAT THIS IS DONE WITH A SPECIFIC VERSION OF THESE TOOLS, IF YOU
UPGRADE, YOU WILL HAVE TO REGENERATE THE INDEXES
******************************
***../database/updateAll.sh***
******************************

Note: For alignment of nanopore genomic/transcriptomic reads, we recommend aligning to a file comprised of human genome chromosome and HLA-I and -II alleles to reduce the noise in alignments (especially when running minimap2). If you are predicting from direct ONT (nanopore) or PacBio long read alignments, please update the genome files:
<pre>
cd database
cat GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_genomic.chr-only-noChr6.fa HLA-I_II_GEN.fasta | pigz - > GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_genomic.chr-only-noChr6-HLA-I_II_GEN.fa.gz

### OUTPUT FILES <a name="OUTPUT"></a>
--------

HLA predictions from read pair alignments:

HLAminer_HPRA.log
HLAminer_HPRA.csv

HLA predictions from targeted assemblies:

HLAminer_HPTASR.log
HLAminer_HPTASR.csv

The .log file tracks the process of HLA mining. It contains the following information:
-HLAminer command and parameters utilized
-Contig/read pair alignment output and best HLA hit for each
-Initial gene summary, score and expect value
-Final summary, listing all predictions by highest score (more likely).

The .csv file contains HLAminer predictions.  Predictions are listed by HLA
gene and ranked by highest score.  Predictions 1) and 2) are expected to
represent the two alleles for each.

eg.
<pre>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
MOST LIKELY HLA-I ALLELES (Confidence (-10 * log10(Eval)) >= 30, Score >= 500)
Allele,Score,Expect (Eval) value,Confidence (-10 * log10(Eval))
----------------------------------------------------------------------

HLA-A
Prediction #1 - A*26
        A*26:33,4179,5.22e-124,1232.8

Prediction #2 - A*33
        A*33:24,1791,2.41e-75,746.2

Prediction #3 - A*68
        A*68:05,597,1.85e-10,97.3
</pre>

From these predictions, the individual is expected to be heterozygous with HLA-I A alleles A*26 and
A*33. The chance, expect value and confidence are different representations of the same
metric. The Confidence represents the Expect value - Eval - as a score in a
manner analoguous to the phred score employed in sequencing to quickly assess
the likelihood of a base being correct. 

Predictions/read pair are ambiguous when there are multiple predicted allele groups and/or protein coding alleles with the same score.
